This repository contains code used in "Protein language model-guided engineering of an anti-CRISPR protein for precise genome editing in human cells"

Briefly, we provide code to calculate the ESM-1v-based hotspot scores and scripts to process NGS data generated by the AcrobaTx high-throughput DNA repair profiling workflow.
